I am a Professor of Mathematics at Simon Fraser University. I work on the development and analysis of numerical methods for scattering and spectral problems, including FEM and integral equation methods. Apart from this, I enjoy using mathematics to solve real-world problems wherever they arise. I'm particularly interested in applications of mathematics in physiology.
I currently serve on the editorial boards of the Mathematics-in-Industry Case Studies, Computers and Mathematics with Applications, and SIAM News. I also serve on the series editorial boards of the CMS/CAIMS Book Series in Mathematics, and the SIAM Book Series on Mathematics and Computation.
