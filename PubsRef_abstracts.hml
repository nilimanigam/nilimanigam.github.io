 Wave enhancement through optimization of boundary conditions.

<blockquote>
It is well-known that changing boundary conditions for the Laplacian from Dirichlet to Neumann can result in significant changes to
	the associated eigenmodes, while keeping the eigenvalues close. We
	present a new and efficient approach for optimizing the transmission signal between two points in a cavity at a given frequency, by
	changing boundary conditions. The proposed approach makes use
	of recent results on the monotonicity of the eigenvalues of the mixed
	boundary value problem and on the sensitivity of the Green’s function to small changes in the boundary conditions. The switching
	of the boundary condition from Dirichlet to Neumann can be performed through the use of the recently modeled concept of metasurfaces which are comprised of coupled pairs of Helmholtz resonators.
	A variety of numerical experiments are presented to show the applicability and the accuracy of the proposed new methodology.

 A proof via finite elements for Schiffer's conjecture on a regular

<blockquote>
 A modified version of Schiffer's conjecture on a regular pentagon states that Neumann eigenfunctions of the Laplacian do not change sign on the boundary. In a companion paper by  Bartlomiej Siudeja it was shown that eigenfunctions which are strictly positive on the boundary exist on regular polygons with at least 6 sides, while on equilateral triangles and cubes it is not even possible to find an eigenfunction which is non-negative on the boundary. 
  
    The case for the regular pentagon is more challenging, and has resisted a completely analytic attack. 
    In this paper, we present a validated numerical method to prove this case, which involves iteratively bounding eigenvalues for a sequence of subdomains of the triangle.  We use a learning algorithm to find and optimize this sequence of subdomains, making it straightforward to check our computations with standard software. Our proof has a short proof certificate, is checkable without specialized software and is adaptable to other situations.

 The energy of muscle contraction. i. Tissue force and deformation

<blockquote>
During contraction the energy of muscle tissue increases due to energy from the hydrolysis of ATP. This energy is distributed across the tissue as strain-energy potentials in the contractile elements, strain-energy potential from the 3D deformation of the base-material tissue (containing cellular and extracellular matrix effects), energy related to changes in the muscle's nearly incompressible volume and external work done at the muscle surface. Thus, energy is redistributed through the muscle's tissue as it contracts, with only a component of this energy being used to do mechanical work and develop forces in the muscle's longitudinal direction. Understanding how the strain-energy potentials are redistributed through the muscle tissue will help enlighten why the mechanical performance of whole muscle in its longitudinal direction does not match the performance that would be expected from the contractile elements alone. Here we demonstrate these physical effects using a 3D muscle model based on the finite element method. The tissue deformations within contracting muscle are large, and so the mechanics of contraction were explained using the principles of continuum mechanics for large deformations. We present simulations of a contracting medial gastrocnemius muscle, showing tissue deformations that mirror observations from magnetic resonance imaging. This paper tracks the redistribution of strain-energy potentials through the muscle tissue during fixed-end contractions, and shows how fibre shortening, pennation angle, transverse bulging and anisotropy in the stress and strain of the muscle tissue are all related to the interaction between the material properties of the muscle and the action of the contractile elements.

 A modelling approach for exploring muscle dynamics during cyclic
  contractions.
 <em>PLoS Computational Biology</em>, 2018.
[&nbsp;<a href="PubsRef_bib.html#Ross2018">bib</a>&nbsp;]
<blockquote>
Hill-type muscle models are widely used within the field of biomechanics to predict and understand muscle behaviour, and are often essential where muscle forces cannot be directly measured. However, these models have limited accuracy, particularly during cyclic contractions at the submaximal levels of activation that typically occur during locomotion. To address this issue, recent studies have incorporated effects into Hill-type models that are oftentimes neglected, such as size-dependent, history-dependent, and activation-dependent effects. However, the contribution of these effects on muscle performance has yet to be evaluated under common contractile conditions that reflect the range of activations, strains, and strain rates that occur in vivo. The purpose of this study was to develop a modelling framework to evaluate modifications to Hill-type muscle models when they contract in cyclic loops that are typical of locomotor muscle function. Here we present a modelling framework composed of a damped harmonic oscillator in series with a Hill-type muscle actuator that consists of a contractile element and parallel elastic element. The intrinsic force-length and force-velocity properties are described using Bézier curves where we present a system to relate physiological parameters to the control points for these curves. The muscle-oscillator system can be geometrically scaled while preserving dynamic and kinematic similarity to investigate the muscle size effects while controlling for the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator. The model is driven by time-varying muscle activations that cause the muscle to cyclically contract and drive the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator. Thus, this framework provides a platform to test current and future Hill-type model formulations and explore factors affecting muscle performance in muscles of different sizes under a range of cyclic contractile conditions.

 Size, history-dependent, activation and dimensionality effects on the
  work and power produced during cyclic muscle contractions.
 <em>Integrative and Comparative Biology</em>, 2018.
[&nbsp;<a href="PubsRef_bib.html#dominguez2018">bib</a>&nbsp;]
<blockquote>
Muscles undergo cycles of length change and force development during locomotion, and these contribute to
	their work and power production to drive body motion. Muscle fibers are typically considered to be linear actuators
	whose stress depends on their length, velocity, and activation state, and whose properties can be scaled up to explain the
	function of whole muscles. However, experimental and modeling studies have shown that a muscle’s stress additionally
	depends on inactive and passive tissues within the muscle, the muscle’s size, and its previous contraction history. These
	effects have not been tested under common sets of contraction conditions, especially the cyclic contractions that are
	typical of locomotion. Here we evaluate the relative effects of size, history-dependent, activation and three-dimensional
	effects on the work and power produced during cyclic contractions of muscle models. Simulations of muscle contraction
	were optimized to generate high power outputs: this resulted in the muscle models being largely active during shortening, and inactive during lengthening. As such, the history-dependent effects were dominated by force depression
	during simulated active shortening rather than force enhancement during active stretch. Internal work must be done
	to deform the muscle tissue, and to accelerate the internal muscle mass, resulting in reduced power and work that can be
	done on an external load. The effect of the muscle mass affects the scaling of muscle properties, with the inertial costs of
	contraction being relatively greater at larger sizes and lower activation levels.

An integral equation method for solving the Yukawa-Beltrami equation on a multiply-connected sub-manifold of the unit sphere is presented. A fundamental solution for the Yukawa-Beltrami operator is constructed. This fundamental solution can be represented by conical functions. Using a suitable representation formula, a Fredholm equation of the second kind with a compact integral operator needs to be solved. The discretization of this integral equation leads to a linear system whose condition number is bounded independent of the size of the system. Several numerical examples exploring the properties of this integral equation are presented.

In this article we consider regularizations of the Dirac distribution with applications to prototypical elliptic and hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). We study the convergence of a sequence of distributions SH to a singular term S as a parameter H (associated with the support size of SH) shrinks to zero. We characterize this convergence in both the weak-* topology of distributions, as well as in a weighted Sobolev norm. These notions motivate a framework for constructing regularizations of the δ distribution that includes a large class of existing methods in the literature. This framework allows different regularizations to be compared. The convergence of solutions of PDEs with these regularized source terms is then studied in various topologies such as pointwise convergence on a deleted neighborhood and weighted Sobolev norms. We also examine the lack of symmetry in tensor product regularizations and effects of dissipative error in hyperbolic problems.

 A boundary integral algorithm for the Laplace Dirichlet-Neumann

<blockquote>
We present a novel integral-equation algorithm for evaluation of Zaremba eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, that is, eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator with mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions; of course, (slight modifications of) our algorithms are also applicable to the pure Dirichlet and Neumann eigenproblems. Expressing the eigenfunctions by means of an ansatz based on the single layer boundary operator, the Zaremba eigenproblem is transformed into a nonlinear equation for the eigenvalue μ. For smooth domains the singular structure at Dirichlet-Neumann junctions is incorporated as part of our corresponding numerical algorithm—which otherwise relies on use of the cosine change of variables, trigonometric polynomials and, to avoid the Gibbs phenomenon that would arise from the solution singularities, the Fourier Continuation method (FC). The resulting numerical algorithm converges with high order accuracy without recourse to use of meshes finer than those resulting from the cosine transformation. For non-smooth (Lipschitz) domains, in turn, an alternative algorithm is presented which achieves high-order accuracy on the basis of graded meshes. In either case, smooth or Lipschitz boundary, eigenvalues are evaluated by searching for zero minimal singular values of a suitably stabilized discrete version of the single layer operator mentioned above. (The stabilization technique is used to enable robust non-local zero searches.) The resulting methods, which are fast and highly accurate for high- and low-frequencies alike, can solve extremely challenging two-dimensional Dirichlet, Neumann and Zaremba eigenproblems with high accuracies in short computing times—enabling, in particular, evaluation of thousands of eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions for a given smooth or non-smooth geometry with nearly full double-precision accuracy

 The effect of intramuscular fat on skeletal muscle mechanics:

<blockquote>
Skeletal muscle accumulates intramuscular fat through age and obesity. Muscle quality, a measure of muscle strength per unit size, decreases in these conditions. It is not clear how fat influences this loss in performance. Changes to structural parameters (e.g. fibre pennation and connective tissue properties) affect the muscle quality. This study investigated the mechanisms that lead to deterioration in muscle performance due to changes in intramuscular fat, pennation and aponeurosis stiffness. A finite-element model of the human gastrocnemius was developed as a fibre-reinforced composite biomaterial containing contractile fibres within the base material. The base-material properties were modified to include intramuscular fat in five different ways. All these models with fat generated lower fibre stress and muscle quality than their lean counterparts. This effect is due to the higher stiffness of the tissue in the fatty models. The fibre deformations influence their interactions with the aponeuroses, and these change with fatty inclusions. Muscles with more compliant aponeuroses generated lower forces. The muscle quality was further reduced for muscles with lower pennation. This study shows that whole-muscle force is dependent on its base-material properties and changes to the base material due to fatty inclusions result in reductions to force and muscle quality.

<blockquote>
Using molecular dynamics and classical continuum concepts, we investigated the effects of hydrogen functionalization on the fracture strength of graphene and also on the interfacial properties of graphene–polymer nanocomposite. Moreover, we developed an atomistic model to assess the temperature and strain rate dependent fracture strength of functionalized graphene along various chiral directions. Results indicate that hydrogen functionalization at elevated temperatures highly degrade the fracture strength of graphene. The functionalization also deteriorates the interfacial strength of graphene–polymer nanocomposite. Near-crack-tip stress distribution depicted by continuum mechanics can be successfully used to investigate the impact of hydrogen passivation of dangling carbon bonds on the strength of graphene. We further derived a continuum-based model to characterize the non-bonded interaction of graphene–polymer nanocomposite. These results indicate that classical continuum concepts are accurate even at a scale of several nanometers. Our work provides a remarkable insight into the fracture strength of graphene and graphene–polymer nanocomposites, which are critical in designing experimental and instrumental applications.

<blockquote>
Skeletal muscle can contain neuromuscular compartments that are spatially distinct regions that can receive relatively independent levels of activation. This study tested how the magnitude and direction of the force developed by a whole muscle would change when the muscle activity was regionalized within the muscle. A 3D finite element model of a muscle with its bounding aponeurosis was developed for the lateral gastrocnemius, and isometric contractions were simulated for a series of conditions with either a uniform activation pattern, or regionally distinct activation patterns: in all cases the mean activation from all fibers within the muscle reached 10%. The models showed emergent features of the fiber geometry that matched physiological characteristics: with fibers shortening, rotating to greater pennation, adopting curved trajectories in 3D and changes in the thickness and width of the muscle belly. Simulations were repeated for muscle with compliant, normal and stiff aponeurosis and the aponeurosis stiffness affected the changes to the fiber geometry and the resultant muscle force. Changing the regionalization of the activity resulted to changes in the magnitude, direction and center of the force vector from the whole muscle. Regionalizing the muscle activity resulted in greater muscle force than the simulation with uniform activity across the muscle belly. The study shows how the force from a muscle depends on the complex interactions between the muscle fibers and connective tissues and the region of muscle that is active.

Integral equation methods for solving the Laplace-Beltrami equation on the unit sphere in the presence of multiple "islands" are presented.

After discretizing the integral equation, the resulting dense linear system is solved iteratively using the fast multipole method for the 2D Coulomb potential in order to calculate the matrix-vector products. This numerical scheme requires only O(N) operations, where N is the number of nodes in the discretization of the boundary. The performance of the method is demonstrated on several examples.

<blockquote>
White noise-driven nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) of parabolic type are frequently used to model physical and biological systems in space dimensions d = 1,2,3. Whereas existence and uniqueness of weak solutions to these equations are well established in one dimension, the situation is different for d ≥ 2. Despite their popularity in the applied sciences, higher dimensional versions of these SPDE models are generally assumed to be ill-posed by the mathematics community. We study this discrepancy on the specific example of the two dimensional Allen-Cahn equation driven by additive white noise. Since it is unclear how to define the notion of a weak solution to this equation, we regularize the noise and introduce a family of approximations. Based on heuristic arguments and numerical experiments, we conjecture that these approximations exhibit divergent behavior in the continuum limit. The results strongly suggest that a series of published numerical studies are problematic: shrinking the mesh size in these simulations does not lead to the recovery of a physically meaningful limit.

<blockquote>
We examine the effect of numerical integration on the convergence of high order pyramidal finite element methods. Rational functions are indispensable to the construction of pyramidal interpolants so the conventional treatment of numerical integration, which requires that the finite element approximation space is piecewise polynomial, cannot be applied. We develop an analysis that allows the finite element approximation space to include rational functions and show that despite this complication, conventional rules of thumb can still be used to select appropriate quadrature methods on pyramids. Along the way, we present a new family of high order pyramidal finite elements for each of the spaces of the de Rham complex.

In this paper, we are concerned with the error analysis for the finite element solution of the two-dimensional exterior Neumann boundary value problem in acoustics. In particular, we establish explicit priori error estimates in <em>H</em><sup>1</sup> and <em>L</em><sup>2</sup>-norms including both the effect of the truncation of the DtN mapping and that of the numerical discretization. To apply the finite element method (FEM) to the exterior problem, the original boundary value problem is reduced to an equivalent nonlocal boundary value problem via a Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) mapping represented in terms of the Fourier expansion series. We discuss essential features of the corresponding variational equation and its modification due to the truncation of the DtN mapping in appropriate function spaces. Numerical tests are presented to validate our theoretical results.

 The cellular dynamics of bone remodeling: a mathematical model.

<blockquote>
The mechanical properties of vertebrate bone are largely determined by a process which involves the complex interplay of three different cell types. This process is called bone remodeling and occurs asynchronously at multiple sites in the mature skeleton. The cells involved are bone resorbing osteoclasts, bone matrix producing osteoblasts, and mechanosensing osteocytes. These cells communicate with each other by means of autocrine and paracrine signaling factors and operate in complex entities, the so-called bone multicellular units (BMUs). To investigate the BMU dynamics in silico, we develop a novel mathematical model resulting in a system of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) with time delays. The model describes the osteoblast and osteoclast populations together with the dynamics of the key messenger molecule RANKL and its decoy receptor OPG. Scaling theory is used to address parameter sensitivity and predict the emergence of pathological remodeling regimes. The model is studied numerically in one and two space dimensions using finite difference schemes in space and explicit delay equation solvers in time. The computational results are in agreement with in vivo observations and provide new insights into the role of the RANKL/OPG pathway in the spatial regulation of bone remodeling.

<blockquote>
Sharp upper bounds for the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian on a surface of a fixed area are known only in genera zero and one. We investigate the genus two case and conjecture that the first eigenvalue is maximized on a singular surface which is realized as a double branched covering over a sphere. The six ramification points are chosen in such a way that this surface has a complex structure of the Bolza surface. We prove that our conjecture follows from a lower bound on the first eigenvalue of a certain mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary value problem on a half-disk. The latter can be studied numerically, and we present conclusive evidence supporting the conjecture.

Geometric integration theory can be employed when numerically solving ODEs or PDEs with constraints. In this paper, we present several one-step algorithms of various orders for ODEs on a collection of spheres. To demonstrate the versatility of these algorithms, we present representative calculations for reduced free rigid body motion (a conservative ODE) and a discretization of micromagnetics (a dissipative PDE). We emphasize the role of isotropy in geometric integration and link numerical integration schemes to modern differential geometry through the use of partial connection forms; this theoretical framework generalizes moving frames and connections on principal bundles to manifolds with nonfree actions.

<blockquote>
In this dissertation, we consider a class of boundary value problems which are posed exterior to a thin domain. We are interested in the asymptotic behavior of the solutions as the thickness of the thin region approaches zero.<p>
A general solution procedure for the class under consideration is proposed. The computational domain is reduced to a finite region by means of integral equations, and a variational formulation for the resulting nonlocal boundary value problem is carefully studied. Certain a priori estimates are established. Thereafter, we scale the domain along the thickness, and use a regular asymptotic expansion to approximate the exact solution. This results in a family of simpler variational problems to be solved. We examine solvability issues for this sequence of problems, and may use the a priori estimates to justify the procedure.<p>
The study is carried out with reference to three specific problems which belong to this class. We first exhaustively study a simple model problem, and apply the techniques developed to subsequently analyse a time-harmonic scattering problem. In both these cases we are able to rigorously justify the asymptotic procedure. We then consider a fluid-structure interaction problem, and extend the general procedure to study it. Finally, some computational results are presented.
