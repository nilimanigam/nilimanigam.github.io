<h1>Positions</h1>

<h4> Please note: I will not be accepting applications for graduate positions for the Fall 2026.</h4>
 
<h4> PhD positions</h4>

Applications are invited for PhD positions in the Department of Mathematics at Simon Fraser University

in the broad area of applied mathematics. The applied mathematics group at SFU is one of the largest

and most vibrant in Canada. The Pacific Northwest has a high concentration of expertise in numerical

analysis and scientific computing, which provides many opportunities for collaboration.

<br>


<li> Why apply? </li>Candidates will be part of an intellectually stimulating, friendly and supportive atmosphere at SFU. The

PhD positions are fully funded, and there are no citizenship constraints. All candidates with a strong

mathematical background are encouraged to apply. For more details, please contact faculty in the Dept. of Mathematics at SFU.

<h4> The fine print</h4>
I believe that applied mathematics is the right discipline for you if you are deeply interested in mathematics, but are also curious about the natural world. You have to be prepared to learn a LOT of new things. If you're adept in mathematics, you'll need to learn about the deeper issues in your preferred area of application. If you're well-versed in physics/chemistry/biology/engineering, you'll have to learn a lot of mathematics.


There are many views of the optimal training for a graduate student. My personal views are:

<li>take as many courses as you possibly can. </li>

<li> retain a very open mind to all fields of mathematics, and if possible, learn at least a little about them. you never know what you'll need.</li>    

 <li>start reading background literature on your research topic early. don't be a passive reader. </li>   

  <li> get ready to feel ignorant a lot of the time.</li>  

 <li>indulge your curiosities, but channel your efforts. </li>   

 <li>be a Renaissance thinker. no question too simple, no topic too off-beat. you're at a university, so soak yourself in the atmosphere. Trust me, it's very different outside the Tower.
 </li>   
  <li> beyond a certain point, you have to be self-motivated and able to manage your time. there won't be structured homeworks or tasks - a PhD has a big element of creativity and originality. this is hard at first.
