<h1> Research</h1>




My mathematical interests are in the numerical analysis of differential and integral equations, employingvariational, perturbative and geometric strategies, with a focus on scattering problems inacoustics, electromagnetics, and linear elasticity. I also maintain an active program in problemsarising in interdisciplinary and industrial applications. 
Some of the projects I've worked on, and continue to be interested in, are:

<li>Scattering from thinly-coated objects</li>
<li> High-accuracy Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps
<li> Preconditioning strategies for first-kind integral equations
<li>Boundary integral equations on manifolds
<li>  Laplace-beltrami eigenvalues  on compact manifolds and for the mixed problem
<li>Conforming high-order finite elements on pyramids

<br>

One of the most rewarding features of an academic life is the opportunity to work on research-related problems with students, and I usually have several projects suitable for graduate research. It's little harder to locate good undergraduate projects, and those I supervise tend to be more interdisciplinary in nature.
